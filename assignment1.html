    <h1>Matthew Strayhorn</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>In high school, I had a web development class where I first learned html and css.The goal of the class was to make a simple website about anything we wanted.<br> We also had to use dreamweaver :(.</li>
      <li>For my summer job 2 years ago I helped work on the company's website by helping to clean up their code and providing some of my own html code.</li>
      <li>Taking CS 1520 at Pitt will be my third excursion into web development.</li>
    </ul>
    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!
